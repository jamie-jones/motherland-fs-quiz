# Motherland: Fort Salem Specialization Quiz
This is a fanmade Motherland: Fort Salem Specialization Quiz created by the Motherland: Fort Salem Research Institute (MFSRI) R&D. If you want to know which specialization you would be in in the MFS universe, take this short quiz to find out! The quiz starts off on the "start quiz" button, which when clicked, will begin the quiz. There are seventeen (17) main questions and one (1) tiebreaker question that the user may or may not have at the end of the quiz. The questions consists of two (2) - six (6) answers, equally categorized to give all four specializations a fair chance at being picked. Once the seventeen main questions are answered, depending on if you have two or more tied results, the tiebreaker question will appear with the answers of the tying results only. After the user answers the final question or the tiebreaker, they are given their specialization with a description of what the specialization is like.

Below your result, you have the option to submit what you believed you were before taking the quiz. There is also a share button. In the top left corner of the application, there is a clickable logo for the MFSRI that will send you to its official Tumblr.
